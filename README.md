## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run `resume_builder` on your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume_builder.git
    cd resume_builder
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies isolation.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project relies on Django and other Python packages. While no `requirements.txt` was detected, you will need to install Django and any other necessary libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install Django
    # You may need to install additional packages based on project specifics,
    # e.g., pip install Pillow (for image handling), djangorestframework (if APIs are planned), etc.
    ```
    *(Note: If a `requirements.txt` file becomes available in the future, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.)*

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    The project uses Django's ORM. Initialize the database schema by running migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations resume
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser (optional, but recommended for administration):**
    To access the Django administration panel, create an administrative user:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up your admin username, email, and password.

6.  **Run the development server:**
    Start the Django development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will now be accessible in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## üöÄ Usage

Once the development server is running, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.

1.  **Register or Log In**: If you're a new user, register for an account. Otherwise, log in with your existing credentials.
2.  **Access Dashboard**: Upon successful login, you will be directed to your personal dashboard.
3.  **Create New Resume**: Click the "Create New Resume" button (or similar interface element) to begin building your resume.
4.  **Input Details**: Fill in the required sections, including personal information, work experience, educational background, skills, projects, and any other relevant accomplishments.
5.  **Select Template**: Choose from the available professional templates that best align with your desired aesthetic and industry standards.
6.  **Preview and Download**: Preview your resume to ensure all details are accurate and formatting is correct. Once satisfied, click the "Download PDF" button to save your high-quality resume.

### Accessing the Admin Panel

If you created a superuser, you can access the powerful Django administration interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. Use your superuser credentials to log in and manage users, application data, and potentially templates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

The primary configuration for `resume_builder` is managed within the `settings.py` file, typically found in your main project directory (e.g., `your_project_name/settings.py`).

Key configurations you might want to review or modify include:

*   **`SECRET_KEY`**: A critical security setting. **Always set this to a strong, unique value in a production environment.**
*   **`DEBUG`**: Set to `True` for development, `False` for production. Disabling `DEBUG` in production is crucial for security and performance.
*   **`ALLOWED_HOSTS`**: A list of host/domain names that this Django site can serve. Required when `DEBUG` is `False`.
*   **`DATABASES`**: Defines database connection settings. By default, Django uses SQLite, but you can configure it for PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
*   **`STATIC_URL`**, **`STATIC_ROOT`**, **`MEDIA_URL`**, **`MEDIA_ROOT`**: Settings for serving static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) and user-uploaded media files.

**Example: Configuring `DATABASES` for PostgreSQL**

```python
# In your project's settings.py file
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'resume_builder_db',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost', # Or your database server IP/hostname
        'PORT': '5432',      # Default PostgreSQL port
    }
}
```

## üìö API Documentation

`resume_builder` is primarily designed as a standalone, user-facing web application. At this stage, it does not expose a public RESTful API for external consumption. All core interactions and functionalities are accessible directly through the web interface.

*Should future development introduce a public API, this section will be expanded to include detailed endpoint documentation, request/response formats, authentication methods, and usage examples.*
